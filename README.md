# ANPR-and-ATCC-for-Smart-Traffic-Management
Project Statement:
This project aims to develop an intelligent traffic management system using Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) and Automatic Traffic Classification and Control (ATCC). By leveraging Deep Learning and Object Detection techniques, the system will automate traffic monitoring and control in smart city environments. ANPR will detect and recognize vehicle license plates, while ATCC will classify different types of traffic and automate traffic signals accordingly. The system will improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety.

Outcomes:

•	Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR): Real-time detection and recognition of vehicle license plates.

•	Automatic Traffic Classification and Control (ATCC): Automated classification of vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, motorcycles) and dynamic control of traffic signals based on traffic volume.

•	Efficient Traffic Management: Reduce congestion and optimize traffic flow by automating traffic control processes.

•	Smart City Integration: Seamless integration into smart city infrastructures for enhanced urban mobility and road safety.

Modules to be Implemented:

1.	ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition)
2.	ATCC (Automatic Traffic Classification and Control)
3.	System Integration and Optimization
4.	Testing and Validation
